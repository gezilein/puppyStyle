Power of large numbers is not possible in native javascript (returns Infinity), so I used https://github.com/peterolson/BigInteger.js, which seems to work fine for large numbers (with high exponents).
The drawback is that all numbers are generated and used as integer.
Also the default number of numbers in array was taken down to 10, but feel free to make it higher if you have the time and resources :)
